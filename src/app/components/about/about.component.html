          <p><b>Phase 1: Iowa Roots | 1980-2001</b></p>
          <p>I was born and raised in Iowa.  I completed a two-year degree in LAN Management at Kirkwood Community College.  During this time, a trip starting in Cancun, Mexico and then sidetracking to Belize and Guatemala with a friend, changed my life forever.  This experience sparked a larger desire to see the world.  I went on more trips including a multi-country excursion from Mexico all the way to Panama and Peru.  I also took a trip to Hawaii, which motivated me to move there and continue my education.</p>

          <p><b>Phase 2: Paradise Found | 2002-2007 </b></p>
          <p>Before graduating and moving to Hawaii I began studying Japanese.  I decided to pursue a degree in Asian Studies in a place like Oahu because of the large prevalence of Japanese culture.  During the beginning of my studies I was awarded the Honda Scholarship to study in Osaka, Japan for a year.  The time in Japan was by far the most rewarding thing in my life because I was able to fully immerse myself in Japanese language and culture.  Japanese culture really clicked with me and I soaked up the zen nature of the society.  Upon completing my study abroad, I returned to Hawaii to finish my degree.  At that time, an old friend invited me to teach a technology course at a school that he worked at in Bangkok, Thailand.</p>

          <p><b>Phase 3: Land of Smiles | 2008-2013 & 2014</b></p>
          <p>I moved to Thailand and all in all spent about 6 years teaching English to students ranging from kindergarten to middle school.  Being involved in the educational system proved to be very rewarding for me. During this time I consistently tried to enrich myself with studying the Thai language and being immersed in the international melting pot known as Bangkok.  I really enjoyed living in Thailand but I was far from family and I didn’t see a lot of opportunity to build a career.  I decided to return to the U.S. and join my family who had migrated to Atlanta.</p>

          <p><b>Current Phase: City of Trees | 2013, 2015 and Present </b></p>
          <p>I immediately fell in love with Atlanta’s lush green trees coupled with its creative energy and thriving technological scene.  While I knew Atlanta was the perfect fit for me, I was still struggling to find the right career path.  Drawing on my previous experience in LAN, I started to study for a Cisco Certification until I heard about the Iron Yard.  I spent a little over a month prepping for this intensive course which proved to be the most challenging thing I have ever done. The course pushed me to my limit, and I came out stronger because it.  During this time I have developed a love for JavaScript and its many related technologies.  Being able to build and create things is a truly self-gratifying experience.  Now that I have found my passion, I am dedicated on building a long and successful career in this city of trees I now call home.</p>
